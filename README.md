**AI-Based Disease Prediction Using Blood Samples**

Project Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-based disease prediction system using patient blood test data.
The goal is to accurately predict possible diseases while ensuring fairness, reliability, and real-world usability, even when some diseases appear less frequently in the dataset.
To achieve this, a Balanced Random Forest model is used instead of traditional machine-learning approaches. This model prevents bias toward common diseases and improves predictions for rare and critical conditions.
The system is designed with:
Leakage-safe preprocessing
Overfitting control
Evaluation on completely unseen test data
In addition to the AI model, the project includes a backend and frontend, allowing users to input blood test values and receive predictions in real time.

**Key Features**

Disease prediction using blood sample data
Balanced Random Forest for fair classification
Leakage-safe data preprocessing
Proper label encoding without test contamination
Noise injection to reduce overfitting
Incremental tree training with early stopping
